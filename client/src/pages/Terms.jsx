            Unlimited Access Software License with Termination Rights
          </h3>
          The CompressIt Software License allows users to acquire CompressIt
          through a one-time purchase, granting unlimited access to its complete
          features. It is designed for individual creators, entrepreneurs, and
          small businesses who need efficient image compression solutions. This
          license is straightforward with no recurring fees or subscriptions.
          However, the licensor reserves the right to terminate the license at
          any time without prior notice. This right of termination ensures
          flexibility in managing software distribution and usage.

          refund. We believe this is more than enough time to test and evaluate
          our service. Once this five-day period has passed, no refunds will be
          issued. To get a refund, please contact the owner.
